<!-- The idea is to have a header with a photo alligned to the left, with black background color and gold lettering that is aligned to the right. It also should have a link to the Thinkful website. The main part of my page should Have all text centered and justified using a wrapper. It should also include gold text for the main text with black lettering for headers and lists. The main section should have an introduction with a dot list, an about me and a contact section with github link and a link to my linkedin page. All links on the page should be gold unless when the mouse is hovering it should turn white and when it is clicked on should turn red. The footer should have the same color scheme as the header with the text centered! -->

    <!-- This is my header with my name, a photo image and a link to the Thinkful websit. The background color should be black with gold text and a link to the thinkful webpage.-->

            <h3 class="center-text">About Me</h3>
            <p>Being a single parent driving for rideshare companies gave me freedom to be everywhere a father needed to be at anytime. Because of Covid 19 that lifestyle has changed and so that means I must make a change.</p>
            <p>Change, thats where <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> enters my life. I am diving headfirst into a new career in web development and coding. I can't wait to work with other developers to create something from scratch that can make life easier or world changing programs. Fresh ideas and creation is bubbling up on the inside and I can't wait to share my ideas with the world. </p>
            <p>While I am championing the world of coding with my top notch skills, I plan to travel like I never did before. To be able to go to places around the world is a goal I have and that I will accomplish. Another thing thats on my bucket list is rollercoasters. Although I am terrified of heights, I love rollercoasters.</p>
